## WeatherWise

## Project Overview

**WeatherWise** is a Java-based program that suggests activities based on the current temperature. The user is prompted to input the temperature, and the program provides a suitable activity recommendation based on predefined temperature ranges.

## Features

- **Temperature Input:** The program asks the user to enter the current temperature.
- **Activity Suggestions:** Depending on the temperature, the program suggests one of the following activities:
  - **Below 5°C:** Skiing
  - **Between 5°C and 15°C:** Going to the cinema
  - **Between 15°C and 25°C:** Going for a picnic
  - **Above 25°C:** Swimming
- **User Interaction:** Simple console-based interaction for a seamless experience.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the key components in the code:

- **Variable Declarations:** The `temperature` variable stores the user-inputted temperature.
- **User Input:** The program uses `Scanner` to read the temperature input from the user.
- **Conditional Statements:** The `if-else` statements determine the appropriate activity based on the entered temperature.
- **Output:** The program prints the suggested activity to the console.
- **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close();` method is used to close the `Scanner` object and release resources.

## Example Usage

Here's how the program works:

```bash
Enter the temperature: 
20
You can go for a picnic.
```
